DirectX9 Cel Shading Demo

Cartoon shading (Cel Shading) is a rendering technique that gives a 3D scene the look and feel of a cartoon environment; it makes use of an implementation of a 1D texture map, lighting and vector math to produce cartoon effect.  

The application incorporates both the cel shader effect itself as well as well as the outline effect that draws a solid black outline around the vertices with one forward facing edge and one backward facing edge to highlight the visible boundary of the model.
